# Test Qupas

## Demo
https://qupas-de5c11.netlify.com

## Getting Started
First, clone the repo via git:
```
git clone https://github.com/rickhysis/test-qupas.git
```

And then install the dependencies with npm or yarn.
```
$ cd test-qupas
$ npm install
// or
$ yarn
```

## Usage

Start the app in the dev environment. This starts the renderer process in hot-module-replacement mode and that sends hot updates to the renderer process:
```
$ npm run start
or
$ yarn start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app, if it isn’t automatically opened for you.

Once you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build. Then, you can test your minified bundle by calling npm run serve.

For more details on the available commands, see the Scripts guide on the Create React App website.
